        /**
            Initialize a database connection using the supplied database connection string
            @param adapter Database adapter to use. E.g. "sqlite"
            @param connectionString Connection string stipulating how to connect to the database. The format is one of the 
            following forms:
                <ul>
                    <li>adapter://host/database/username/password</li>
                    <li>filename</li>
                </ul>
                Where adapter specifies the kind of database. Sqlite is currently the only supported adapter.
                For sqlite connection strings, the abbreviated form is permitted where a filename is supplied and the 
                connection string is assumed to be: <pre>sqlite://localhost/filename</pre>
         */
