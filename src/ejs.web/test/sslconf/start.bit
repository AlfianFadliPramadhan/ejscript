/*
    start.bit -- Appweb ssl certificate file
 
    This file provides targets to help you get going with SSL (using OpenSSL). 
    WARNING: All these certificates are for internal use only.

    To generate a certificate request to send to a certificate authority like Verisign, do:
    This will create a certificate request file in "server.csr" and a private key in "server.key"

        bit certReq
 
    To use appweb with HTTP, you need a server certificate. 
    This command will generate a self-signed test certificate called "self.crt" with a private key "self.key".
 
        bit selfSigned
 
    To create a CA and then a server cert based on this CA, do:
    This command will generate a CA certificate in ca.crt with a CA private key in ca.key. The last minted certificate
    serial number is in ca.srl.
 
        bit ca

    To generate a certificate signed by the test CA, do:
    This will generate a certificate in "test.crt" with a private key in "test.key".
        bit cert

    For all cert targets:

        bit certs
