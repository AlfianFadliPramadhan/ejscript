Composite Sample
---

The composite sample demonstrates how to create a composite class that contains both
scripted properties and native properties. The class object is not native and is created
and managed by the runtime. The native module is called composite and the native class is
called Shape.

## Files:

    Shape.es          - Class file for the Shape class
    Shape.c           - Native methods for the Shape class. Also contains the modules 
                        initialization entry point.
    composite.slots.h - Generated slot offsets for the Shape class. Generated by ejsmod.
    main.es           - Main test program

## To build inside appweb source:

    bit

## To build inside appweb and show commands:

    bit -s

## To build outside on MACOSX:

    cc -shared -dynamiclib -I/usr/include/ejs -L/usr/lib/ejs/2.0.0/lib -o composite.dylib -lejs -lmpr shape.c

## To run:

    ejs main.es

## Requirements:
    The sample could be adapted for use in static programs if you manually
    invoke the ejsControlModuleInit() function from your main program.
