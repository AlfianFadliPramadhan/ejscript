Composite Sample
---

The composite sample demonstrates how to create a composite class that contains both
scripted properties and native properties. The class object is not native and is created
and managed by the runtime. The native module is called composite and the native class is
called Square.

## Files:

    Square.es         - Class file for the Square class
    Square.c          - Native methods for the Square class. Also contains the modules 
                        initialization entry point.
    composite.slots.h - Generated slot offsets for the Square class. Generated by ejsmod.
    main.es           - Main test program
