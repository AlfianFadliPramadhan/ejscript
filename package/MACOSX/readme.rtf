Installation Package Formats\
\
The Appweb binary installation is published in several formats:\
\
    * Native Apple MAC OS X DMG/PKG format\
    * Native Linux RPM format\
    * Native Linux Debian format\
    * Native Windows installer format\
    * Tar format for custom self installs.\
\
Most formats are wrapped in a compressed Tar archive with this README.TXT file.  It is recommended that you use one of the native O/S formats if your system supports it. The native formats will typically register the software installation with your system's software manager so that you can query, verify, and easily manage the software on your system.  The installation package includes binaries, development libraries, and headers.  \
\
The Tar format consists of tar archives that you can manually extract for maximum control over the placement of various product components.\
\
For those looking to build from source code, you will need to download the separate source code distribution. The product documentation describes how to build from source. \
\
\
Development Environment Platform Support\

If you wish to embed Appweb in your application or build Appweb from source code, you will need to use a C compiler and associated development tools.  Several development environments are supported.  You may choose any of the following:\
\
    * Linux/Unix/Solaris GNU Tools\
\
    * Windows Visual Studio (Visual Studio 2008 (Express) or the Cygwin UNIX \
      emulation tools. See www.cygwin.com.\
\
    * WindRiver Tornado Development Tools\

Installating the Tar Self-Install Image\
\

\
   1. Uncompress and extract the image by typing\
\
      tar xvzf appweb-VERSION-BUILD-DIST-OS-ARCH.FMT.tgz\
\
      where FMT is "tar".\
\
   2. Invoke the installation script with administrator privilege\
\
      sudo ./install\
\
\
\
Apple Mac OS X Release Details\
\
To install the native MAC OS X DMG image:\
\
   1. Download the DMG image.\
\
   2. Double click on the DMG file image. This will mount a new drive called\
      appweb-VERSION. Double click on this drive to display its contents.\
 \
   3. Double click on the "appweb.mpkg" image.\
\
   4. Answer the questions as prompted.\
\
\

\
      tar xvfz appweb-VERSION-BUILD-DIST-LINUX-ARCH.FMT.tgz\
\
      Where FMT is "rpm" or "deb".\
\

      you are doing a Tar self-install, the install script will complete the\
      installation for you.\
\
      sudo ./install\
\
\
Windows Release Details\
\
To install the Windows Installer image:\
\
   1. Login with administrator privileges. This is necessary as the binary \
      installation needs to install a Windows Service.\
