MVC(1)                           User Commands                          MVC(1)

<B>NAME</B>
       mvc  -  Ejscript  Application  Generator for Server-Side JavaScript Web
       Applications.

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
       <B>mvc </B>[<I>--database DB]</I>] [<I>--full</I>] [<I>--keep</I>] [<I>--layout layoutPage</I>]  [<I>--listen</I>
       <I>port[--min[--overwrite[--quiet[--verbose</I>] [commands ...]

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
       The  <B>mvc </B>command generates, manages and runs Ejscript web applications.
       It can generate Ejscript web applications, controllers, database migra-
       tions, models, scaffolds and views.

       Mvc  will create directories and generate configuration and source code
       files which can then be manually edited as required.  Mvc  is  intelli-
       gent  and will not overwrite existing files, so you can safely edit and
       regenerate without losing your changes. You can overwrite your  changes
       if you wish to by using the <B>--overwrite </B>switch.

       Mvc can run your application by invoking a configured web server.

<B>GENERATING APPLICATIONS</B>
       To  start  a  new  web  application,  run <B>mvc </B>to create the application
       directory and generate  the  application  configuration  and  essential
       script files. For example:

             <B>mvc generate app myApp</B>

       This  will  will  create  a set of directories which have the following
       meaning:

             bin            - Programs and scripts
             cache          - Cached views and web pages
             controllers    - Controller source
             db             - Databases and scripts
             db/migrations  - Databases migration scripts
             layouts        - Template layout files
             models         - Database model code
             src            - Extra application source code
             views          - View source files
             static         - Public web directory
             static/images  - Public images
             static/js      - Client side JavaScripts
             static/themes  - Application HTML themes

       Ejscript follows conventions where  specific  files  are  stored.  This
       greatly simplifies configuring a web application.

       Mvc will also create some files which have the following meaning:

             ejsrc                       - Application configuration file
             controllers/Base.es         - Application base controller class
             layouts/default.ejs         - Default layout web page
             static/layout.css           - Default layout CSS file
             static/themes/default.css   - Default theme CSS file
             static/js/jquery.js         - Jquery client side script
             README                       - Documentation explaining files and
            directories

<B>GENERATING CONTROLLERS</B>
       Controllers  are  the  primary  mechanism  for  responding  to   client
       requests. To generate a controller, run:

             <B>mvc generate controller NAME [actions...]</B>

       This  will  create a controller of the requested name. It will create a
       controller class file in the <B>controllers </B>directory. If action names are
       requested,  the  controller class will define an action method for each
       name. If not action names are requested,  mvc  will  define  a  default
       action  named <B>index</B>.  Actions are controller functions that are invoked
       in response to client requests. You can edit the controller  source  to
       meet your needs.

<B>GENERATING MODELS</B>
       Database models are Ejscript classes that encapsulate database data and
       provide access methods. They provide a conduit  to  interact  with  the
       database. To generate a model:

             <B>mvc generate model MODEL [field:type ...]</B>

       This will create a database model and will generate a model class under
       the <B>models </B>directory.  It will also create a database migration to cre-
       ate a database table of the same name as the model.  If field:type val-
       ues are supplied, the database migration will include code to create  a
       column  for each specified field of the requested type. The valid data-
       base types are: binary, boolean, date, datetime, decimal, float,  inte-
       ger, number, string, text, time, timestamp.

<B>GENERATING SCAFFOLDS</B>
       A  scaffold  is  a  generated  database migration, database model, con-
       troller and set of views that provides add, edit and list functionality
       for  a database model.  Scaffolds are useful to quickly generate chunks
       of the application and prototype web pages and actions for  managing  a
       datbase table.  To generate a scaffold:

             <B>mvc generate scaffold MODEL [field:type ...]</B>

       This  will  create a scaffold for the specified database model and will
       generate a controller of the same name.  If field:type values are  sup-
       plied,  the database migration will include code to create a column for
       each specified field of the requested type. The  valid  database  types
       are:  binary, boolean, date, datetime, decimal, float, integer, number,
       string, text, time, timestamp.   The  scaffold  will  include  an  edit
       action  and view that provides add and edit capability. The list action
       and view, provides the ability to list  the  database  table  rows  and
       select an entry to edit.

<B>GENERATING MIGRATIONS</B>
       Database  migrations  are  scripts  which modify the database schema or
       content. You can create database migrations by the <B>mvc generate  migra-</B>
       <B>tion  </B>command.  This command generates a migration for a specific model
       by creating or removing tables and columns. To generate a migration:

             <B>mvc generate migration description MODEL [field:type ...]</B>

       This will create a migration script under the <B>db/migrations  </B>directory.
       Migration  scripts filenames are timestamped and use the description is
       used as part of the filename for the migration script (so keep it short
       and sweet).

       For  each  specified field:type pair, mvc will generate add column code
       in the migration script. If the --reverse  switch  is  specified,  then
       remove  column  code will be generated. To change the type or name of a
       column, remove then re-add the column.

<B>APPLYING MIGRATIONS</B>
       Migration scripts can be run via the <B>mvc migrate </B>command. With no other
       parameters,  the command will run all migrations that have not yet been
       applied to the database. You can also use <B>mvc migrate forward </B>to  apply
       apply the next unapplied migration. Similarly <B>mvc migrate backward </B>will
       reverse the last applied migration.  You can also use <B>mvc  migrate  NNN</B>
       to  migrate  forward  or  backward  to a specific migration. NNN is the
       migration sequence number which is the  number  at  the  start  of  the
       migration script file name.

<B>COMPILING</B>
       Ejscript compiles models, views and controllers into Ejscript byte-code
       modules. These are then loaded and  run  by  Ejscript  in  response  to
       incoming  client  requests.  Code  is compiled only once but can be run
       many times to service incoming requests.

       In development mode, Ejscript will automatically compile  the  relevant
       portions  of  the  application  if  the source code is modified. It can
       intelligently recompile views, actions, controllers and database models
       as required. However, you can also explicilty recompile portions or the
       complete appliction.

       Mvc can recompile everything via:

             <B>mvc compile</B>

       This will compile each controller  and  view  and  also  recompile  the
       application  and  module  source  code. Module files for each component
       will be generated.

       Mvc also provides options for you to individually  compile  controllers
       and views. To recompile named views or controllers:

             <B>mvc compile view NAMES ...</B>

             <B>mvc compile controller NAMES ...</B>

       Models are compiled with application code into a single module file. To
       recompile the models and application source code:

             <B>mvc compile app</B>

       To compile the entire application and produce a single module file:

             <B>mvc compile all</B>

       To compile stand-alone Ejscript web pages:

             <B>mvc compile path/name.ejs...</B>.

       When compiling views, you can use the <B>--keep  </B>switch  to  preserve  the
       intermediate generated Ejscript source file.

<B>RUNNING</B>
       To run your application:

             <B>mvc run</B>

       This  requires  that  your config/config.ecf file be modified to define
       command to run your web server.

<B>CLEANING</B>
       To clean all generated module files:

             <B>mvc clean</B>

<B>OPTIONS</B>
       Mvc has the following command usage patterns:

             mvc clean
             mvc compile [all | app | controller names | model  names  |  view
            names]
             mvc compile path/name.ejs ...
             mvc generate [app name | controller name [action [, action] ...]|
            model name]
             mvc generate scaffold model [controller] [action [, action]...]
             mvc run

       <B>--database connector</B>
             Select a database connector to use. Currently this switch is  not
             implemented and sqlite is the only connector supported.

       <B>--keep</B>
             Preserve  generated  intermediate  Ejscript  source  files. These
             files are generated when blending views with layout pages.

       <B>--layout layoutPage</B>
             Change the name of the default layout page if  a  view  does  not
             explicitly specify a layout page.

       <B>--overwrite</B>
             Overwrite  existing files. Mvc normally will not overwrite exist-
             ing files. This is to preserve user changes to previously  gener-
             ated files.

       <B>--search ejsPath</B>
             Set  the  module  search path. The module search path is a set of
             directories that the <B>mvc </B>command will use when locating and load-
             ing Ejscript modules.  The search path will always have some sys-
             tem directories appended to the end. These include  paths  speci-
             fied  via the  <B>EJSPATH </B>environment variable and key system direc-
             tories such as the  Ejscript  system  module  directory  and  the
             directory containing the <B>mvc </B>command.

             The  search  path  value  is similar in format to the system PATH
             variable format.  On windows, path segments are separated by  ";"
             and  on Linux, Unix, FreeBSD and MAC, the path segments are sepa-
             rated by ":" delimiters.

             Given a module named "a.b.c" in a script, <B>mvc </B>will use  the  fol-
             lowing search strategy to locate the module:

             1. Search for a module file named "a.b.c.mod"

             2. Search for a module file named "a/b/c.mod"

             3. Search for a module file named "a.b.c.mod" in the search path

             4. Search for a module file named c.mod in the search path

       <B>--verbose </B>or <B>-v</B>
             Run in verbose mode and trace actions to the console.
