<b>description</b>
       the  <b>ejsc </b>command compiles ejscript programs to produce ejscript module
       files containing byte code.  the module files may then be run  via  the
       <b>ejs </b>shell command.

       the  <b>ejsc  </b>command  is  both  a compiler and link editor. inputs can be
       either ejscript source files or ejscript modules that  have  come  from
       previous  invocations  of the <b>ejsc </b>command. outputs will be one or more
       ejscript module files that contain declarations and byte code.

       an output module file will be created for each ejscript  module  direc-
       tive encountered during compilation. a module file will also be created
       for any global variables or functions declared outside a module  direc-
       tive. these global declarations will go into the <b>default </b>module that is
       specially reserved for global declarations.  each module file  will  be
       named according to the module directive name, but with a <b>.mod </b>extension
       appended.

<b>linking</b>
       if <b>ejsc </b>is invoked with the --out switch, all  input  scripts,  modules
       and  any other dependent modules are merged together into a single out-
       put module. the modules retain their logical naming, but are emitted in
       a  single  output module file. when that module file is loaded, all the
       contained modules will be available to the program.  this  creates  not
       only  a  convenient  way  to  package an entire application as a single
       file, it also permits many optimizations by merging the entire applica-
       tion and its dependent modules into a single module.

<b>binding</b>
       the  <b>ejsc </b>compiler will attempt to early-bind all possible variable and
       function references. binding means resolving references to the underly-
       ing  storage  for  properties and functions. doing this at compile time
       usually results in much faster execution at run-time.

       when using the --out switch, the compiler  can  early-bind  all  global
       variables,  functions  and type references, resulting in a much smaller
       and faster application. however, you must not subsequently  load  other
       modules  that  also  have  global  declarations. otherwise the ejscript
       loader will throw an exception. consequently,  the  --out  switch  must
       only  be used to create a complete application including all the appli-
       cation's required modules.

<b>compliance</b>
       ejscript is fully compliant with the javascript  (ecma-262  3.x)  stan-
       dards,  but  it also offers a set of enhancements and fixes designed to
       improve the language and correct some  longstanding  javascript  design
       issues.

<b>options</b>
       <b>--bind </b>bind  global  variable  declarations  into slot references. this
              results in faster more compact code. however,  only  one  module
              can have its global variables bound.

       <b>--debug</b>
              generate  symbolic  debug  instructions.  this  permits symbolic
              debugging of ejscript programs and enables exception stack back-
              traces to include line number information.

       <b>--doc  </b>include  documentation  strings from input scripts in the output
              modules. the <b>ejsmod </b>command can then generate html documentation
              using these doc strings. the format of the doc strings resembles
              that of javadoc.

       <b>--merge</b>
              merge all input files and modules together into a single  output
              module. this option acts like a link-editor combining all inputs
              together. useful if you want to distribute your application as a
              single module file.

       <b>--optimize level</b>
              set  the code optimization level. level values must be between 0
              (least) and 9 (most). default is 9.

       <b>--parse</b>
              just parse the source scripts. don't verify, execute or generate
              output. useful to check the script syntax only.

       <b>--require 'module ...'</b>
              list of modules to preload before compiling input files.

       <b>--search ejspath</b>
              set  the  module search path. the module search path is a set of
              directories that the <b>ejsc </b>command will  use  when  locating  and
              loading ejscript modules.  the search path will always have some
              system directories appended to  the  end.  these  include  paths
              specified  via  the  <b>ejspath </b>environment variable and key system
              directories such as the ejscript system module directory and the
              directory containing the <b>ejsc </b>command.

              the  search  path  value is similar in format to the system path
              variable format.  on windows, path segments are separated by ";"
              and on linux, unix, freebsd and mac, the path segments are sepa-
              rated by ":" delimiters.

              given a module named "a.b.c" in a script, <b>ejsc </b>will use the fol-
              lowing search strategy to locate the module:

              1. search for a module file named "a.b.c.mod"

              2. search for a module file named "a/b/c.mod"

              3. search for a module file named "a.b.c.mod" in the search path

              4. search for a module file named c.mod in the search path

       <b>--standard</b>
              run scripts in standard  mode.  ejscript  supports  two  parsing
              modes: strict and standard. standard mode does not require vari-
              ables be declared and typed before use.

       <b>--strict</b>
              run scripts in standard  mode.  ejscript  supports  two  parsing
              modes:  strict and standard. strict mode requires that all vari-
              ables be declared and typed.

       <b>--version</b>
              print the <b>ejsc </b>command version and exit.

       <b>--warn level</b>
              set the compiler warning verbosity level. level values  must  be
              between 0 (least verbose) and 9 (most). default is 0.

<b>background</b>
       ejscript  is  an enhanced implementation of the javascript language for
       use in embedded applications such as web servers, embedded  and  mobile
       devices.  it is especially suited for server-side javascript web appli-
       cations.

       ejscript is a dynamic, interpreted, object-oriented scripting  language
       that supports classes, objects, exceptions, statements, expressions and
       a powerful suite of data types.
