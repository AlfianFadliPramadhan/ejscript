            <h1>Building with Bit</h1>
            <p>Bit stands for Build It! and is modern replacement for the venerable 
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">make</a> and not so popular 
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoconf">autoconf</a> utilities. Bit manages the building of
            programs and products by effectively determining which pieces have been updated and thus which components
            need to be rebuilt. It easily handles direct compilation and generation of projects.</p>

        <h2>Why Bit?</h2>
        <p>Many projects rely on autoconf to configure products and make to build. But autoconf is a baroque maze of
        scripts and make is provides too little support easily building executable and libraries in a cross platform
        manner. Further, neither of these tools work well on or for Windows and embedded platforms like VxWorks or
        Windows CE. As such, creating portable Makefiles and autoconf scripts that will work on a variety of platforms
        and support cross compilation is an exercise in patience. Often the result is slow, fragile build
        systems, especially on Windows.</p>

        <p>Bit replaces both autoconf and make with a single utility: <em>bit</em>. Bit provides a higher level of
        abstraction to easily specify the targets to build (libraries and executables). It can build directly on Linux,
        Mac or Windows and cross compile for other platforms. It will generate native projects for Visual Studio,
        XCode, Make, Nmake and shell scripts if required. Bit builds fast without the complexity of autoconf and
        make.</p>

        <p>Bit was initiated after evaluating Make, CMake and GYP for use by Appweb and Ejscript in an embedded,
        cross compilation environment. While all three can be made to work, we were expending a large percentage of
        time on the build system and less on the actual product. Our design goals were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Easily manage cross-compilation and cross-compilers</li>
            <li>Support discovery, configuration and integration of external third-party packages</li>
            <li>Generate native projects for IDE integration</li>
            <li>Build quickly on windows without relying on Cygwin</li>
            <li>Support for the entire build cycle: C dependencies, compilation, test and packaging</li>
            <li>Be hackable and extendable</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>Bit is implemented primarily as a single Ejscript of some 3K lines and is very hackable. It has the
        following major features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Configuration and component discovery (replaces autoconf)</li>
            <li>Compiler capability sleuthing</li>
            <li>Generation of a configuration source configuration header (bit.h)</li>
            <li>Generation of Xcode, Visual Studio, Make, Nmake and shell script projects</li>
            <li>Automatic C/C++ source code dependencies</li>
            <li>Projects can aggregate multiple bit files without using recursion</li>
            <li>Cross platform. Easily handles Windows, Linux and Mac builds</li>
            <li>Easy cross-compilation</li>
            <li>Building outside source tree for read-only file systems</li>
            <li>Bit files are JavaScript source and are easily modified and extened</li>
            <li>Multiple build profiles (debug, release, ...)</li>
            <li>FAST configuration and building, even on windows</li>
       </ul>

       <h2>Nice Bits</h2>
       <p>While Bit has a strong feature set, there are some characteristics that make building with Bit especially
       nice:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Unified project view. No "make" style recursion required.</li>
           <li>Bit configuration may be comprised by multiple bit files</li>
           <li>Bit file targets and scripts are relative to their own directory</li>
           <li>Targets can be named symbolicly not just by the target path.</li>
           <li>Bit provides a "why" option (bit --why) to display why a target was or was not rebuilt</li>
           <li>Bit files and targets intelligently inherit of outer project properties</li>
           <li>Bit scripts run using the working directory of the bit file</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>A bit file is a JavaScript file with a '.bit' extension that invokes Bit.load() to process a set of build
        instructions. The build instructions are expressed as a JavaScript object literal that Bit.load()
        integrates into the master set of build instructions.</p>
        <pre>
Bit({
    targets: {
        /* Build the rocket executable */
        rocket: {
            type: 'exe',
            sources: ['*.c'],
        },
    }, })
</pre>

        <p>To build the rocket, enter:</p>
        <pre>bit rocket</pre>

        <h2>Invocation</h2>
        <p>When bit is invoked, it searches for a 'start.bit' file in the current directory. If one if not found, it
        searches up the parent directory chain for one. Bit then loads this 'start.bit' file and commences processing
        its build instuctions. A 'start.bit' may in turn load other bit files.</p>

        <h2>Standalone Use</h2>
        <p>A standalone start.bit file may be used to express simple build targets that do not requiring any prior
        configuration step. The 'start.bit' file contains targets that specify the recipies to build those targets.</p>

        <h2>Configured Products</h2>
        <p>Some products require a configuration phase prior to building with Bit. Configuration involves discovering
        the tools and components available on the current system and the available compiler tool chain support. For
        configured products, bit is first invoked with a "configure" target. Bit then reads a 'main.bit' file which
        describes the project, and generates a 'start.bit' and platform bit file that describes the system.</p>

        <h2>Targets</h2>
        <p>Bit is typically invoked with zero or more targets to build. If invoked with zero targets, Bit will build all
        the out-of-date targets. If a one or more targets are specified, only those targets will be brought up to
        date.</p>
        <p>To build all targets: </p>
            <pre>bit</pre>

        <p>To build several named targets:</p>
        <pre>bit libengine librocket space-program</pre>

        <p>Bit pre-defines several targets:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>configure &mdash; To configure prior to building</li>
            <li>build &mdash; To build all targets</li>
            <li>compile &mdash; Same as 'build'</li>
            <li>clean &mdash; To clean built targets and prepare for rebuilding</li>
            <li>rebuild &mdash; Clean and build</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Configuring</h2>
        <p>To configure a product before building, run Bit using the 'configure' target or alternatively use the
        '--config' switch.  When configuring, Bit will load a 'main.bit' file and use the details from the 'settings'
        properties to tailor the configuration. The settings provide the product name, title, company, version number
        and what required and optional extension packages should be discovered.</p>

        <p>For example, this is a typical 'settings' configuration:</p>
<pre>
settings: {
    product: 'mpr',
    title: 'Multithreaded Portable Runtime',
    company: 'Embedthis',
    version: '4.0.5',
    buildNumber: '4',
    '+required': [ 'utest' ],
    '+optional':  [ 'doxygen', 'man', 'man2html', 'md5', 'matrixssl', 'openssl', 'ssl' ],
},
</pre>

        <p>The 'required' property defines the extensions that are required to be present on the system to build. The
        these properties indicates that these values should be added to pre-defined values. The buildNumber is a
        build patch number.</p>

        <h2>Cross-Compiling</h2>
        <p>To build a product for platform different to that of the local system is called cross compiling.
        Sometimes this cross compiling is just for a different instruction set (say x64 instead of x86). Other times
        it is for a completely different operating system and/or CPU architecture. In such cases a cross-compiler
        may be required to build for the target platform.</p>

        <p>Bit supports cross compiling via the "bit configure --platform OS-ARCH" switch. This adds a platform to the
        list of platforms to be made when building. Multiple platforms may be specified and the 'local' platform alias
        may be used for the local development platform.</p>

       <p>Some products require local building to make tools that are required to build for any platform. These
       products add a "platforms: ['local']" property to their settings collection in the main.bit file. This
       automatically adds the local platform to the platforms list and is the same as adding '--platform local' on the
       command line when configuring.</p>

            <pre>bit --platform windows-x64 -configure .</pre>

       <p>This will create a windows-x64.bit configuration file and a start.es that references it. The platform
       switch does not need to be respecified after configuration.</p>

        <h2>Project Generation</h2>
        <p>Bit can generate generate complete project files for building using: make, nmake, Visual Studio, Xcode or
        plain shell scripts. Bit uses the '--gen' switch to specify the projects to build. Bit is capable of
        cross-generating projects for non-native platforms. For example: you can generate an Xcode project for Mac OS
        X on a Windows system.</p>

            <pre>bit --continue --platform macosx-x64 configure -gen xcode,make,sh</pre>

        <p>This will generate Xcode, make and shell script projects for a Mac OS X 64-bit. The continue switch indicates
        that generation should continue even if the required compilers and build tools are not present on the
        development system.</p>

        <h2>Dependencies</h2>
        <p>Bit targets can depend on other targets that must be built first. Bit targets have a name which may be
        depended upon by another target. For example:</p>
<pre>
targets {
        first: {
            build: "print('Build First')",
        },
        second: {
            depends: ['first'],
            build: "print('Build Second')",
        }, 
}
</pre>

        <p>Before Bit begins building, it parses the entire bit file configuration and determines which targets depend
        on what. It then builds the targets in the required build order. It successfully detects and handles dependency
        loops.</p>

        <h2>Defaults</h2>
        <p>Often targets need very similar configuration. Bit provides a 'defaults' set of properties that are inherited
        by all targets. It also provides an 'internal' set of properties that are inherited by only the targets in the
        same bit file. For example:</p>
<pre>
defaults: {
    '+defines': [ '-DTUNE=SPEED ],
    '+libraries': [ 'math' ],
}
</pre>
        <p>This will use the 'TUNE=SPEED' compiler define when compiling all source files, and the 'math' library when
        linking executables (and libraries on some systems).</p>

        <h2>Debugging</h2>
        <p>With Make and other build tools, it is difficult to determine why a target is or is not being built. Bit
        provides a '--why' switch to diagnose problematic build sequences. This switch displays the reason why each
        target was or was not built.</p>

        <p>In a complex project containing many Bit files, it can be helpful to see the entire bit configuration in one
        file. Use the '--dump' switch to save a copy of the entire configuration. In the dump, build defaults are fully
        expanded to each target contains the expanded configuration that will be used to build the target.</p>

        <p>By default, Bit builds relativley quietly and stops on the first build error. To see the commands Bit is
        issuing, use the '--show' switch. To build totally quietly, use the '--quiet' switch. To continue building
        despite build errors, use the '--continue' switch.</p>

                        based on the instructions specified in a 'main.bit' located in the specified path source tree.
                        When run, bit will create a platform configuration bit file, a build output directory and
                        bit.h header. The configuration directory is of the form: OS-ARCH-PROFILE where OS may be
                        freebsd, linux, macosx, solaris, vxworks, windows and ARCH is arm, mips, ppc, x64 or x86.
                        PROFILE is typically set to debug or release. For example: 'macosx-x86_64-debug'. The
                        configuration bit file omits the PROFILE. For example: 'linux-x86.bit'.</p>

                        <p>Bit will use the settings.required and settings.optional properties in the main.bit for a
                        list of packages to use. When configuring, bit will search for these packages and will
                        create definitions in the configuration bit file for later use.</p></td>
